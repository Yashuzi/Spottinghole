## Likely Impact

In this fast-moving world, people want to reach their destinations as soon as possible. Some apps suggest the routes which can make us reach our goal early, and other apps show all possible ways with traffic congestion for whatever reason it may be, such as google maps and many more.

But there are fewer apps that tell the condition of the road, whether it is good to travel or not, whether it suggests the route to the driver based on the state of the way. So this model mainly focuses on the travel safety of the passengers and updates the passengers with the best route to travel.
